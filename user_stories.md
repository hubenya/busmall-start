#Marketing

  As a Marketing I want to see what images are more popular when randomly displayed on the page so that we can see what age group we can target using these images. For example, As a marketing researcher, I want to keep track of the images the user clicks on so that I can determine which items are the most popular.

#Developer
  As a developer I want to create a functional website where user will have an option to select one image at the time and give user random 25 options to see what images they would pick each time they have new set of 3 displayed. In the end user would be notified what images were selected.

#User
  As a User I want to have an ability select one image out of 3, so marketing team can determine what images are more popular among others when randomly presented.
